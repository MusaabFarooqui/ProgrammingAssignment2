##These functions written for the Week 3 Assignment

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse
}


## Write a short comment describing this function

## This function computes the inverse "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix.
## If  the matrix is has not been chnaged adn the inverse has already been calculated,
##cacheSolve will retrieve the inverse from the cache. 


cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        
}
